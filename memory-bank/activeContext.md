# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Setting up the Spring Boot project and integrating with Twilio, Gemini, and a weather API.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Updated the plan to remove the database dependency for PIN code validation.
*   Confirmed the SMS/WhatsApp provider (Twilio), LLM API (Gemini), and the weather API requirement (provides details according to the PIN code).

**Next Steps:**

*   Explore the existing project structure.
*   Add the necessary dependencies to the `pom.xml` file.
*   Implement the Webhook endpoint.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Choosing the right weather API that provides detailed information based on the PIN code.
*   Handling potential API rate limits for both the weather API and the LLM API.
*   Ensuring the security of API keys and credentials.
